This project aims to use story and data to help audiences understanding the experience of the Rohingya Muslim refugees after being persecuted and forced from their homes. Using geodata, images, videos,  and narrative, the user is guided through the Rohingya's history of oppression and conflict at the hands of the Myanmar military. Moving to the present, we examine the most recent ethnic cleansing operation committed by the Myanmar military that has committed that has displaced over one million people.  More than 900,000 have escaped death in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh.  Empty handed, traumatized, and exhausted, the small hope of temporary safety and new life in Kutupalong dims quickly. Resources are limited and conditions are squalor, with constant threat of dangerous environmental conditions, diseases, and crime in the camp. 

 Look, listen and learn as refugees share their experiences.
